# Networks

## Network: Introduction

A computer ntwork is a group of computer systems and other compuing hardware devices that are linked together through communication channels to facilitate communication and resource-sharing among a wide range of users. Networks are commonly categorized based on their characteristics.

Topics related to networking include:
* Architecture and Troubleshooting
* Infrastructure Provisioning
* Directory Services

## Network: Architecture

Newtork Architecture is the complete framework of an organization's omputer network. The diagram of the network architecture provides a full picture of the established network with detailed view of all the resources accessible. It includes hardware components used for communication, cabling and device types, network layout and topologies, physical and wireless connections, implemented areas and future plans. In addition, the software rules and protocols also constitute to the network architecture. This architecture is always designed by a network manager/administrator with coordination of network engineers and other design engineers.

Cloud computing architecture refers to the components and subcomponents required for cloud computing. These components typically consist of a front end platform (fat client, thin client, mobile device), back end platforms (servers, storage), a cloud based delivery, and a network (Internet, Intranet, and Intercloud). To briefly summarize, the front-end is the part you see, and the back-end is the computing that happens behind the scenes.

Cloud services can be delivered publicly or privately using the internet and can also remain within a company's network when delivered over an intranet. Sometimes, organizations make use of a combination of both.

No matter where the actual "cloud" is -- a company's own data center or a service provider's data acenter, cloud computing uses networking to enable convenient, on- demand access to a shared pool of computing resources like networks, storage, servers, services, and applications. By using virtualization, these assets can be provisioned and released quicly and easily as necessary.

Because of technology like **virtualization** and **hypervisors**, it's possible for many virtual servers to exist on a single physical server. These technologies power other cloud subscriptions like Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), and more.

* Front End Platform
	* Front-end is the side that is visible to the client, customer, or user. Front-end pieces include the user interface, and the client's computer system or network that is used for accessing the cloud system.

* Back End Platform
	* The backend pieces are on the side used by the service provider. These include various servers, computers, data storage systems, virtual machines, and programs that together consitute the cloud of computing services. The back-end side also is responsible for providing security mechanisms, traffic control and protocols that connect networked computers for communication.

* Cloud Based Delivery
	* Cloud computing services are everywhere these days. For example, if you use QuickBooks for your accounting, or Expedia to schedule your travel, or Netflix to watch your favorite series, you're a cloud computing user. These are all examples of subsciptions a company or individual can purchase that enable them to use the software, typically known as Software-as-a-Service, or Saas.


## Suggesting Reading: What is Amazon VPC?

Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) enables you to launch AWS resources into a virtual network that you've defined. This virtual network closely resembles a traditional network that you'd operate in your own data center, with the benefits of using the scalable infrastructure of AWS

#### Amazon VPC Concepts

Amazon VPC is the networking layer for Amazon EC2. If you're new to Amazon EC2, see [What is Amazon EC2?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/concepts.html) in the *Amazon EC2 User guide for Linux Instances* to get a brief overview.

The following are the key concepts for VPCs:

* A *virtual private cloud* (VPC) is a virtual network dedicated to your AWS account.

* A *subnet* is a range of IP addresses in your VPC

* A *route table* contains a set of rules, called routes, that are used to determine where network traffic is directed.

* An *internet gateway* is a horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available VPC component that allows communication between instances in your VPC and the internet. It therefore imposes no availability risks or bandwidth constraints on your network traffic.

* A *VPC endpoint* enables you to privately connect your VPC to supported AWS services and VPC endpoint services powered by PrivateLink without requiring an internet gateway, NAT device, VPN connection, or AWS Direct Connect connnection. Instances in your VPC do not require public IP addresses to communicate with resources in the service. Traffic between your VPC and the other service does not leave the Amazon network.

#### Accessing Amazon VPC

You can create, access, and manage your VPCs using any of the following interfaces
* AWS Management Console
* AWS CLI
* AWS SDKs
* Query API


## Dependency from Suggested Reading: What is Amazon EC2?

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) provides scalable mputing capacity in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud. Using Amazon EC2 eliminates your need to invest in hardware up front, so you can develop and deploy applications faster. You can use Amazon EC2 to launch as many or as few virtual servers as you need, configure security and networking, and manage storage. Amazon EC2 enables you to scale up or down to handle changes in requirements or spikes in populaarity, reducing your need to forecast traffic.

## Network: Provisioning

Provisioning is the enterprise-wide configuration, deployment and management of multiple types of IT system resources. An organization's IT or HR department oversees the provisioning process, which is applied to monitor user and customer access rights and privacy while ensuring enterprise resource security.

## Network: Directory Service

Directory services are software systems that store, organize, and provide access to directory information in order to unify network resources. Directory services map the network names of network 
resources to network addresses and define a naming structure for networks.

The directory service provides transparency to protocols and network topology, permitting users to access resources without having to be aware of the physical location of the devices. It's an important component of the network operating system and is a central information repository for a service delivery platform.
