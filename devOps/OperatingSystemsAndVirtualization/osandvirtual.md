# Module 1: Platforms: Operating Systems and Virtualization

## Platform: General
* Platform: Group of technologies used as base upon which other applications, processes, or technologies are developed.
	* In personal computing: a platform is basic hardware (computer) and software (operating system) on which software applications can be run

* Topics related to platform technologies: **Operating Systems** | **Virtualization**

## Platform: Operating Systems

### Definition of an operating system

An operating system (OS), in its most general sense, is software that allows a use to run other applications on a computing device. While it is possible for a software application to interface directly with the hardware, the cast majority of applications are written for an OS, which allows them to take advantage of common libraries and not worry about specific hardware details.

The operating system manages a computer's hardware resources, including:
* Input devices such as a keyboard and mouse
* Output devices such as modems, routers, and network connections
* Storage devices such as internal and external drives
* The OS also provides services to facilitate the efficient execution and management of, and memory allocations for, any additional installed software application programs.
