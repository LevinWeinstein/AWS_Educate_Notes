# Module 1: Platforms: Operating Systems and Virtualization

## Platform: General
* Platform: Group of technologies used as base upon which other applications, processes, or technologies are developed.
	* In personal computing: a platform is basic hardware (computer) and software (operating system) on which software applications can be run

* Topics related to platform technologies: **Operating Systems** | **Virtualization**

## Platform: Operating Systems

### Definition of an operating system

An operating system (OS), in its most general sense, is software that allows a use to run other applications on a computing device. While it is possible for a software application to interface directly with the hardware, the cast majority of applications are written for an OS, which allows them to take advantage of common libraries and not worry about specific hardware details.

The operating system manages a computer's hardware resources, including:
* Input devices such as a keyboard and mouse
* Output devices such as modems, routers, and network connections
* Storage devices such as internal and external drives
* The OS also provides services to facilitate the efficient execution and management of, and memory allocations for, any additional installed software application programs.

### How are Operating Systems used in the cloud?

One example is by using Amazon EC2. This service presents a true virtual computing environment, allowing you to use web service interfaces to launch instances with a variety of operating systems, load them with your custom application environment, manage network's access permissions, and run your image using as many or few systems as you desire.

## Platform: Virtualization

### Explaining virtualization

Virtualization refers to the creation of a virtual resource such as a server, desktop, operating systems, file, storage, or network. The main goal of virtualization is to manage workloads by radically transforming traditional computing to make it more scalable. Virtualization has been a part of the IT landscape for decades now, and today it can be applied to a wide range of system layers including operating system-level virtualization, hardware-level virtualization and server virtualization.


### How is virtualization used in the cloud?

Virtualization is software that manupulates hardware, while cloud computing refers to a service that results from tha manipulation. *You can't have cloud computing wihhout virtualization.*

VMware is an example of platform virtualization software.
